# Ubuntu Repository Generator Scripts

## Goals

Our goal is to create a deb repository with packages we need to be up to date that aren't provided through other means.


## History

This was forked from tamersaadeh/oab-java which is a fork of flexiondotorg/oab-java6. It was modified to suit the needs of Team DIANA and is highly oriented to our specific needs. However, it can still be of use to others, as such we have decided to release it.
